Python Directory: 1)PyBank and 2)PyPoll

Each directory has two sub-directories: 1)analysis and 2)Resources

The resources directory contains data file and the analysis directory has a python script (.py). 

1) PyBank/analysis: main.py,  2) PyPoll/analysis: pypoll.py
2) PyBank/Resources: budget_data.csv, 2) PyPolll/Resources: election_data.csv

Each python script can read a data file from each "Resources" directory.

So, To run the scripts correctly, each "Resources" directory with its csv file must be located properly.

I knew how to set a file path from linux-wise root directory, but I used '..' which is parent directory to direct Resouces directory.
